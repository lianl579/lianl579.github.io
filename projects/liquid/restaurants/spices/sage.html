            Remember that one kid in school who was always in his own little world? It was so hard to define him. He marched to his own drum. That’s pretty much sage. A true individual.

		    Though popular in French and Croatian cooking, other cultures are still trying to figure it out. Ground Sage has a sweet, but herbaceous and very savory flavor that’s reminiscent of celery, eucalyptus, parsley, and a bit of pine.

			The difference between rubbed sage and ground sage: rubbed is simply crumbled apart and has a lighter, downy texture. Ground is a powder. Ground sage is great for many recipes when you need it to lend a bit of background flavor, but if you need a pronounced sage flavor or want a unique texture, then use rubbed.
