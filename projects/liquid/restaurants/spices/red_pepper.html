            The average Italian family usually just keeps salt and black pepper at the table. The lucky families with a flare for drama and fine food keep a container of crushed red pepper flakes. So what kind of family is yours?

		    Spicy red pepper flakes contain both the dried flesh of the pepper and the seeds. Both are cured and lightly toasted to create a smoky and spicy pepper flake. These pepper flakes provide a medium all-purpose heat â€“ use on pizza, pasta, baked potatoes, macaroni and cheese, soups, salads, grilled meats and nearly everything else.
