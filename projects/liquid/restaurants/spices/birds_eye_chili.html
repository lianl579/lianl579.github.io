            A word of advice: Don’t shove your nose in the bag and take a deep whiff. It burns. It burns so much. Similarly, don’t eat them whole. Just stick to utilizing their heat and fruity flavors in your dishes.

		   Used extensively in Thai and Vietnamese cuisine, you should feel free to add these to any dish. We mean it. Any dish will welcome a bird’s eye chile. Just keep in mind it’s a medium-high heat pepper and will add a significant spice.
		<br><br>
			The ground form is extremely noxious and can cause weepy eyes and burned nostrils. Please be careful when using. A note: the flavor is less potent when added as a finishing spice. If added at the beginning of cooking, be aware that the entire dish will be made very hot. Add judiciously.
