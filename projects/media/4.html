	<p> The growth of we media could also reflect the lifestyle of modern people - the trend of "fragmented reading". "Fragmented reading" is a phenomenal term appeared after the rising of different types of new media. After researching for this term, I find the word "fragmented" presents a gradual and inevitable process: </p>
	
	<p>At first, people paid for newspaper or magazines as media sources to receive information. Later, people used media as a tool to research for their interests specifically. Nowadays, people are owning the latest media themselves like we media. As a result, media has become more and more personalized and customized. Customization leads to the process of decentralization, and decentralization leads to the concept of "fragmentation".</p>

	<p>The key word for media/communication was integration. As long as the main fields of media are integrated, the information is integrated. That is almost impossible today. People do not wait for hourly news or news in a specific time period of a day. News is updated every second in any possible form of media. People do not buy a magazine for an article, buy a newspaper for a report, or wait for a television channel for a news, instead they can get any information online directly. Though the information online may not be as accurate or complete as the information from traditional media, they are more simple and convenient. No matter if this trend is beneficial or not, due to the trend of the time, information start to be fragmented.</p>
	
	<p>Because of the trend of "fragmented reading", we media emerges at the right time. We media helps to maximize the level of fragmenting information, so that the information is spread much faster and its propagation radius is enlarged. Therefore, nowadays integrating main fields of media is not as useful as cooperating with online communities. It is too early to judge if fragmented reading is a positive trend or not, what is sure now is that this is an inexorable trend of media.</p>
