		<p>Yi Zhi Bo</p>

		<p> Yi Zhi Bo is currently one of the most popular we media platforms in China. It is a rising live streaming platform which was just published on May 13, 2016. Till now, it has attracted more than 80 million active users. In China, it has the highest market penetration in the field of live streaming platforms. It is a representative case of how we media could be popularized within a short time. </p>
		
		<p>After research, I find two main qualities from Yi Zhi Bo which lead to its success. First, since more and more people are getting used to use we media to share their lives, to follow their friends' lives, and to make new friends, there is a demand for an epitomizing platform that could bring the "sharing of life" to a more comprehensive level. The slogan of Yi Zhi Bo is to give the microphone to everyone to make live shows, that accords exactly with the demand. Besides, there is no need to worry about the network security because the platform has strict user rules and monitoring staff all the time.</p>

	<p>Change A New Perspective</p>
	<div class="parallax-window" data-parallax="scroll" data-image-src="assets/15.jpg"></div>
	</section>
		
		<p>Second, from the marketing perspective, besides inviting celebrities to be the honorary vice presidents, Yi Zhi Bo provides a huge platform to attract influential people including celebrities, famous bloggers, media industry, and political department to share information with the audience. Celebrities could share their lives, such as their recipes, their skincare routine, and their boring moments while waiting in the backstage. Besides, celebrities could cooperate with social charity organizations by making live shows introducing charity events they attend in order to appeal more people to know about the charity organizations. Media industry include newspaper, websites, and magazines could use the platform during interviews and news report. Viewers could make real-time comments freely in public by the platform. The interviewees could read the comments during the interview to know about viewersâ€™ opinion. For political use, traffic police could share the live traffic condition to the drivers, and the political department could share government announcements interactively with citizens by the platform. </p>

		<p>Twitch</p>
		
		<p>In the US, one of the representative of live streaming platforms is Twitch. It provides live shows about games include DOTA2, LOL, SC2, World of Warcraft, etc. The game players could make money by followers' subscription.o early to judge if fragmented reading is a positive trend or not, what is sure now is that this is an inexorable trend of media.</p>
