	<h1> We Media – Short Video Platforms </h1>  
	<p>Video social network is a rising field in we media. Here are several representative self-made video platforms:</p>

	<p>Vine</p>
	
	<p>Vine can be called the originator of short self-made video. It was launched in June, 2012, and was acquired by Twitter in October of the same year. It allows users to film a short video that is less than 6 seconds. The videos can be shared in multiple social platforms instantly. The function of pausing/changing lens also makes the videos easier to make.</p>

	<p>Dubsmash</p>
	
	<p>Dubsmash allows users to record videos of lip syncing the sound clips from pop songs or famous movies. After the video function becoming popular, Dubsmach was later transformed into an instant messaging application. President of Subsmach, Suchit Dash says that the ultimate goal for this platform is to create a social network platform based on short videos. Since people are using more and more videos in their communication, Dubsmash wants to seize the initiative.</p>

	<p>Snapchat</p>
	
	<p>A strong opponent of Dubsmash in video networking is Snapchat. Snapchat has one and a half hundred million daily active users. 83% of the users come from the age group of 13 – 34. It is widely spread in young generation. Its dynamic sticker function for the video is another successful innovation.</p>

	<p>Xiao Ka Xiu</p>
	<p>Xiao Ka Xiu was created with a clear orientation – to make funny short videos. It has the similar function as Dubsmash, which allows users to make lip syncing videos. However, Xiao Ka Xiu focuses on any video clips those are funny. Its video source includes funny movie scenes, TV series scenes, talk shows, etc. Each video is published as an independent work and users could view, “like”, comment, and share one another’s works to other platforms.</p>

	<p>Kuai Shou</p>
	<p>If Xiao Ka Xiu is a platform which is closer to younger users’ taste, Kuai Shou is a platform which is suitable for all ages. It is a platform that encourage users to create short videos and share to the public. In Kuai Shou, you can find fishing lovers share their fishing experience, hairstylists teach how to make a hairstyle, poker card lovers use poker cards to perform dominoes, street singers performances, cooks record cooking process, dancers teach dancing, pet lovers share tips about their pets, etc.</p>
