        <h2>
            The average Italian family usually just keeps salt and black pepper at the table. The lucky families with a flare for drama and fine food keep a container of crushed red pepper flakes. So what kind of family is yours?
        </h2>
        
        <p>
		    Spicy red pepper flakes contain both the dried flesh of the pepper and the seeds. Both are cured and lightly toasted to create a smoky and spicy pepper flake. These pepper flakes provide a medium all-purpose heat â€“ use on pizza, pasta, baked potatoes, macaroni and cheese, soups, salads, grilled meats and nearly everything else.
