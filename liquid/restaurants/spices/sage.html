            The Thanksgiving Spice – ground sage is a must in gravy, cakes, stuffings, breads, and turkey soup.

		    Though popular in French and Croatian cooking, other cultures are still trying to figure it out. Ground Sage has a sweet, but herbaceous and very savory flavor that’s reminiscent of celery, eucalyptus, parsley, and a bit of pine.

			The difference between rubbed sage and ground sage: rubbed is simply crumbled apart and has a lighter, downy texture. Ground is a powder. Ground sage is great for many recipes when you need it to lend a bit of background flavor, but if you need a pronounced sage flavor or want a unique texture, then use rubbed.
