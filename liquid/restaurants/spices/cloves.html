            There are few spices we joyfully use as tiny harpoons. When was the last time you stabbed a ham all over with allspice berries? A little violent, perhaps, but goodness that makes for a tasty ham.

		    The clove actually isn’t a stick or piece of wood, but actually a dried and unopened flower. These flowers are originally native to the Moluccas, a chain of volcanic islands near Indonesia. Few people ever see the delicate red flowers due to the spice’s popularity.

			The clove is used in nearly all world cuisines. While Asian, African, and Middle Eastern countries tend to lean toward its use in savory foods, in Europe and the Americas it’s often used in breads and sweets.

			The clove also has a history of medical use. Their essential oils have the ability to assist digestion by increasing stomach acid, relax muscles in the body, and whole cloves work as oral painkillers (pop one in your mouth next to a sore tooth).
