            Black pepper makes up one-fifth of the world’s spice trade due to its ubiquitous use in nearly all world cuisines. The only spice traded more than pepper is salt. Our ground pepper is cracked fresh and promises only the most prominent flavor.

		    When archaeologist uncovered Ramses II, they found black peppercorns stuffed in his nostrils – this was part of the ritual mummification process. During the Age of Discovery, black pepper and the profit of the spice trade was one of the reasons Portugal, Spain, France, and other European nations sailed the world and expanded the map; to find new sources of spice. Nearly all pepper traded in the ancient world made its way through Malabar, on the Indian Peninsula, and is the main reason the region developed as a major port and trading post in the ancient world. Indeed, black peppercorns play a distinct part in human history that is more entrenched in the development of nations than we understand.
