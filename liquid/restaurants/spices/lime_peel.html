        <h2>
            A musky flavor of lime that loves sweet rolls and a fine cigar. An adult flavor that can't be achieved with fresh limes.
        </h2>
        <p>
		    When dried and granulated lime peel’s fresh and clean aroma gives way to a floral, huskier, sweeter one. Think of Rose’s lime juice, or a lime flavored candy. It’s a unique flavor that only cured lime can provide. We love to add a pinch of this to polenta or grains such as farro and sorghum as they cook.

			A pinch added directly to doughs for bread, flatbread or pizza gives the baked products an interesting zing. On the flip side, dust your pizza peel with a combination of cornmeal and granulated lime peel.
