        <h2>
            Japanese seven spice. Abruptly spicy. Somewhat sour. Quite nutty. A tad salty. A common condiment for ramen or seasoning homemade crackers.
        </h2>
        <p>
		    The name shichimi togarashi actually means “seven flavor chile”. The mixture actually contains more than seven ingredients and “flavor” here walks the lines of pungent, spicy, salty, nutty, etc.

			This blend is carefully handcrafted and balanced with an emphasis on spice. This mixture is indeed spicy by Japanese standards, but true heatmongers will find it pleasant as opposed to molten. The kick comes from red chile pepper, but milder chiles are often added for their acidity and fruit-flavors. This blend also has ginger, sea salt, black and white sesame seeds, orange peel, ground nori (a type of seaweed often used for sushi), and sansho (a berry with a lemony-peppery flavor).

			This is often used as a condiment for soups and noodle dishes, but also tossed onto homemade crackers or other salty snacks.
