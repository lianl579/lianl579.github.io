            A dainty olive-colored powder with a deep hue that might cause it to be mistaken for a couture and invigoratingly aromatic cosmetic.

        <p>
		    This tropical grass is native to Southeast Asia, but has become a popular garden herb and landscaping plant in temperate climates such as the Mediterranean and California. The sharp, slender leaves aren’t of much use, but the fibrous bulb is incredibly aromatic. Bruise it up and the volatile oils emerge from the verdant slumber with a clean, perky smell of lemon and lime.

			Lemongrass is too fibrous to be edible unless minced very finely, but mincing can be rather tedious when it comes to these sturdy stalks. Instead, ground lemongrass offers the flavor without the busting, bruising, and fishing out. (Nothing upsets a curry experience like chomping into a stalk of lemongrass.) This powder should be liberally applied both at the beginning of a soup or stock to build flavor, and at the end to release fresh the aromatics. In addition, it’s a quirky spice to rub on pork ribs, scallops, or chicken breasts.
