        	<p>When I decided to make combination of 3 squares, I immediately chose three-primary colors - blue, yellow, and purple as the theme. To add more variaties to the shapes, I use hover to give different opacities to the shapes: 100%, 66%, and 51%. The squares are also overlapped with transparency, which gives the color effect of orange and purple.</p>
