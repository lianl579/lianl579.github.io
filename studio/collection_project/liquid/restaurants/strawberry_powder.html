        <h2>
            Plump, ruby red strawberries are picked in the height of Spring before being freeze-dried into a pale pink powder.
        </h2>
        <p>
		    Destined for a batch of madelines or perhaps a pound cake, this berry powder imbues a dish with the essence of strawberry and imparts a pale pink hue. In winter, when berries are scarce, we like to add it to homemade granola, yogurt, and piping hot bowls of oatmeal doused in cream and guilty spoonfuls of sugar.
