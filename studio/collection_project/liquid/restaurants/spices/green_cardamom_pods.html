            Green cardamom pods are a collection of contrasts: soft and penetrating, lemony and piney, smoky and clean. These contrasts all balance perfectly in both sweet and savory cooking.

		    A fruit native to India and Papua New Guinea green cardamom pods has been used in sweet and savory cooking for thousands of years throughout India, Asia, Northern Africa, and the Middle East. The Vikings then brought the spice to Scandinavia where it continues to be very popular in baked goods and sweets.

			The flavor is complex, fierce, piney, citric, and a bit peppery. Toasted and ground cardamom is phenomenal in breads, pastries, pork dishes, pilafs, legume dishes, and poultry.
