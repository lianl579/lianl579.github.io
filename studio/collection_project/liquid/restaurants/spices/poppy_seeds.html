            If a white poppy seed were a person he would probably be a traveling mystic. Veils and strange tattoos tempt wayfarers into learning about their futures and seed-studded flatbreads dipped in savory oils welcome them to the campfire.

		    The opium poppy is the very same poppy that gives us the delicious seeds we use in muffins and vinaigrettes. Its scientific name, Papafer somniferum, means “sleep-inducing poppy,” which comes from the poppy seed pod’s latex that is around 12% morphine. (If you’ve never put it together before, this is why it’s a field of poppies that put poor Dorothy Gale and her companions to sleep.)

			While the opium-rich latex within the poppy possesses high levels of narcotics, the actual seeds do not. The seeds have a long rich history and were never harvested for themselves, but as a byproduct of opium production.

			The flavor is somewhat nutty and even a bit citric, and their pinprick crunch is highly valued in baked goods. Blue poppy seeds are sourced produced throughout Europe and possess a distinct almond flavor as opposed to the mellower taste of white and brown poppy seeds.

            Poppy seeds must be toasted or baked before their flavor to be at their peak. Due to their high oil and protein content poppy seeds tend to go rancid quickly so be sure to purchase them in small quantities. Store them in an airtight container in a dark and dry place, but toss after six months.
