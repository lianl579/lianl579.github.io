            A potent powder.
        </h2>
        <p>
		   Used extensively in Thai and Vietnamese cuisine, you should feel free to add these to any dish. We mean it. Any dish will welcome a bird’s eye chile. Just keep in mind it’s a medium-high heat pepper and will add a significant spice.
		</p>
		<p>
			The ground form is extremely noxious and can cause weepy eyes and burned nostrils. Please be careful when using. A note: the flavor is less potent when added as a finishing spice. If added at the beginning of cooking, be aware that the entire dish will be made very hot. Add judiciously.
