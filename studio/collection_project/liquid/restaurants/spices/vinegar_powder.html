		    To make this red wine is dehydrated and turned in a pretty pink powder. (And really, how can you not describe it that way?) Like most vinegar powders this can be added to water to create simple vinegar. However, it’s more often used as a way to make vinegar more portable since it’s lighter than a liquid. Other times it’s used in rubs or marinades for meat. We love to toss it with a bit of olive oil, some crushed garlic, lemon zest, and olives. Marinate overnight and enjoy the next day.
