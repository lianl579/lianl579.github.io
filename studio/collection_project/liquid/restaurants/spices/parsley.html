        <h2>
           Parsley really should go on everything. We know chefs and cooks and trendy magazines say otherwise, but it can reliably bring a bitter-herbal note to dishes and balance them in a jiffy.
        </h2>
        <p>
		 	Remember in the early 2000’s when we finally got over that whole parsley trend and stopped putting it on everything? Well, forget that. That was parsley as a garnish. Parsley as an ingredient brings a needed bitter flavor to food that people often forget to add. If you ever eat a dish and feel it’s missing something then parsley is usually the remedy.
