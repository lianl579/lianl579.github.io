            Popular throughout Japan for hot curry soups in winter and chilled curries with soba in the summer.

        <p>
		    Japanese curries are often milder, sweeter, and with more focus on savory flavors than heat. Japanese cuisine doesnâ€™t have a lot of focus on complex spice blends; so when Japan began to adopt curry powder from India into its cuisine, much of the cumin, cayenne, ginger, and black pepper was reduced. The result is a clean-tasting curry powder with a focus on ginger and turmeric flavors.
