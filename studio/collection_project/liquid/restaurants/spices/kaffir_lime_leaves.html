            The secret weapon for the Grill Master and mysterious tome for the Sister of the Soup Spoon. Both know that should anyone learn how they impart that sweet-sour, floral-citric flavor then the magic will be gone.

        <p>
		    A leaf from an evergreen citrus called the kaffir or makrut lime. While the fruit and zest of the kaffir have plenty of flavor, the leaves are the most prized for their floral scent that straddles the line between lemon and lime. The leaves are generally inedible and, like lemongrass stalks or cinnamon sticks, are fished out of soups and curries before serving. However, finely sliced fresh leaves can be used for garnish.

			The kaffir lime leaf is essential to Thai curries and soups, but many dishes can benefit from their flavor. Fry in a bit of oil for a fragrant kaffir oil to be used to finish salads or soups. Kaffir lime leaves can also be steeped in milk that can then be used in fragrant puddings and custards.

			Ground leaves are an easy way to add a floral citrus flavor to soups, curries, stews, and to homemade curry pastes. Blending it with ground chilies, ground lemongrass, salt, black pepper, and amchoor powder will create a fantastic spice blend for chicken or pork that is spicy, citric, sweet, savory, and sour.
        </p>
        <p>
			If you make your own sausage, add a bit of ground kaffir lime leaf to the next batch. Youâ€™ll be blown away by their Thai-flavored intensity when they hit the searing metal of the grill.
