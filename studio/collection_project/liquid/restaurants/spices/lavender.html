		    One of the most glorious experiences in the world is stepping foot into a lavender field in full bloom. To see a pale violet ocean, infinite in every direction, rippling in the wind is astounding. The air is floral with hints of citrus, camphor, lilac, and mint.

			Used in perfumes, soaps, and essential oils, dried lavender has long been prized for its aroma (and affordability). In cooking, one must be judicious as it can be rather potent. Using too much will cause a dish to go from flavored to soapy. Add to fruit crumble or pies, or infuse into cream and simple syrups. Pairs wonderfully with berries, rhubarb, cream, lemon, and grapes.
