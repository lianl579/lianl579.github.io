            A sulfury, mineral heavy, highly prized salt from Northern India. Used as both flavoring and medicine, kala namak is produced using centuries old methods and sourced from secret locations.

		    Kala namak is also known as black salt, which is odd because when ground into powder itâ€™s pinkish-white. When whole the crystals are dark purple, bordering on black.

			Sourced from Northern India this salt has a long history as a medicinal remedy for indigestion, hysteria, and dental health; but also as a popular spice for chaats and breads (we adore it on oven fries). To make kala namak, salt is melted down with aromatic spice and other various minerals. When it cools and re-crystallizes, the salt picks up various aromas and mineral flavors, though the most notable is an eggy, sulfury smell. The flavor is epic with starchy dishes such as sweet potatoes or with egg dishes such as deviled eggs of egg salad.
